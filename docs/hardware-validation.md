# Hardware capabilities and verification

The Raspberry Pi 4/5 Linux port is experimental. ARM64 CI covers the native
core, service, package installation and updates. USB audio, GPIO, and display
tests use software drivers or test doubles. No physical Pi report is recorded.

Firmware builds and simulator tests check software behavior. A physical verification report records what worked on a particular board revision, wiring, and firmware commit. A passing build alone does not establish that a microphone, power circuit, or display works on a device.

The LCD-1.54 `-EN` SKU uses the same hardware. The separate Touch-LCD-1.54 model adds a CST816 touchscreen that this port does not drive. AMOLED-1.75C has its own firmware profile; its reset and audio clock pins differ from the 1.75 model. See [hardware and wiring](hardware.md) for connections and exact model names.

CI builds and packages these profiles. The browser installer lists profiles included in the latest published release, so newly merged profiles may require a source build until the next release. Other chips, wiring, and unlisted hardware revisions are porting targets, not verified configurations.

## Waveshare 1.85C V2 partial physical report

- **Board:** PCB Rev2.0 speaker-box version with ESP32-S3, 16 MB flash and 8 MB PSRAM, powered over USB.
- **Firmware:** `fb8f81e`, built with ESP-IDF 6.1 and tested on 2026-10-07 after an app-only update to `ota_0` on the same board.
- **Earlier firmware:** combined builds of this port's branch up to `edcbd66`. All of them had the SPI flush-timeout change for every `SpiDisplay` panel. The later ones also had the round settings target. The network tests used the branch's own mapped-IPv4 provisioning guard, which main's `ipv4_of` replaces.
- **Confirmed on `fb8f81e`:** a readable, upright display; touch and brightness; the local test tone; a spoken question with an audible Hermes reply; and swipe-down cancel during a reply. Playback stopped, and the next reply played.
- **Earlier results:** the combined builds passed display, touch, brightness, microphone level, test tone, Wi-Fi setup, WSS, pairing and spoken reply checks.
- **Updates:** Wi-Fi and pairing survived the app-only update to `fb8f81e`. The NVS Wi-Fi, server and device-key entries did not change, and the device reconnected online and paired without setup. Earlier app-only updates passed readback verification with byte-identical NVS and the same paired identity.
- **Earlier power cycle:** on the combined builds, after USB was unplugged and plugged back in, the device reconnected without Wi-Fi setup or re-pairing. This does not test losing Wi-Fi while powered.
- **Not verified:** battery operation, OTA and rollback, long-run stability, interrupting touch or audio, recovery from injected faults, Wi-Fi loss while powered, each microphone on its own, and touch accuracy across the whole screen.
- **Not implemented:** software echo cancellation, battery telemetry and software shutdown.

The port stays experimental.

## Record a physical test

Run this checklist for each board revision and release candidate. Report failed and untested steps explicitly. Do not publish Wi-Fi passwords, access tokens, device keys, or private conversation content.

1. Record the model, PCB revision, flash and PSRAM, firmware commit/version, host OS, Hermes version, power supply, and connected peripherals. Include photographs of the board label and wiring when useful.
2. Install through USB. Check the detected chip and memory, boot logs, display orientation, colors, and readable pairing code.
3. Pair with Hermes. Restart the device and confirm that its identity and pairing survive. Confirm that an unapproved device cannot issue actions.
4. Hold TALK, speak, and release. Check the microphone level, transcript, and a complete spoken reply. Cancel a recording and interrupt a playing reply. Verify every physical button and touch gesture.
5. Test volume and brightness where available. Run the device's hardware checks when its firmware provides them. Record speaker distortion, missing audio, display corruption, or unexpected resets.
6. Disconnect and restore Wi-Fi and the gateway. Confirm recovery without resetting the device identity. Test phone setup with valid and wrong passwords, cancellation, its ten-minute expiry, and recovery to the previous network. Confirm the temporary page is unreachable from the station address. Check USB setup after phone setup closes.
7. On battery-capable ports, record charging, voltage/percentage, dimming, sleep, wake, and power-button results. Mark unsupported power functions as not implemented. Check USB and battery operation separately.
8. Install an OTA update for this exact board. Confirm that settings survive and the new version reaches Hermes. On a recoverable test unit, verify rollback with a candidate that cannot reach the gateway. Keep a USB recovery path ready.
9. Run a two-hour session with repeated voice turns and reconnects. Record resets, audio failures, and memory trends rather than only the final state.
10. Attach a sanitized `hermes-gadget diag --port PORT` report and the relevant logs to the pull request or issue.

## Support labels

- **Experimental:** the port builds and passes automated checks, but no complete physical report is linked for that configuration.
- **Hardware verified:** a linked report identifies the exact revision and tested firmware, covers the checklist, and states any limitations.

A report for one model or revision does not verify another. Keep earlier reports when adding a new one so users can find the firmware and hardware combination they own. Update this page in the same pull request that adds a port or changes its verified capabilities.
