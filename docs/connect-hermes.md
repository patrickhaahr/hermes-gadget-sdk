# Connect Hermes

Use your own Hermes Agent for replies, tools, memory, and skills. Run the commands below on the computer where Hermes is installed.

## 1. Install the plugin

```bash
hermes plugins install https://github.com/Adolanium/hermes-gadget-sdk/tree/main/plugin --enable
hermes gateway setup
```

Choose **Hermes Gadget**. Restart the gateway when setup asks. Setup prints a device address and an installer link with that address filled in.

**You know it worked when:** `hermes gadget info` shows the gadget configuration and device URL. Keep the gateway running so devices can connect.

The command installs from `main`. To match a firmware release, use the command in the [release notes](https://github.com/Adolanium/hermes-gadget-sdk/releases), which pins the plugin with `--ref`.

## 2. Connect a device

For hardware, follow [Set up a board](setup-board.md) and use the installer link from `hermes gadget info`.

For a simulator on the same computer as Hermes:

```bash
hermes-gadget sim --url ws://127.0.0.1:8765/gadget --name "Desk Gadget"
```

If Hermes runs on another computer, replace the URL with the address from `hermes gadget info`. That computer's firewall must allow the gadget port, 8765 by default.

If that port is already in use, [change the gadget port](hermes-integration.md#change-the-gadget-port), restart the gateway, and update the device's server address. Configuration edits and plugin toggles do not change the running listener's port.

## 3. Approve the device

When the device shows a pairing code, run:

```bash
hermes gadget pair
```

Check the device name and code before approving it. You can also run `hermes pairing approve gadget <CODE>` with the code shown on the device.

**You know it worked when:** the device reaches Ready. Type a message in the simulator or use TALK on a board. Replies now come from your Hermes.

## 4. Enable speech

Configure speech recognition and text-to-speech with `hermes tools` and `hermes setup`, or the `stt:` and `tts:` sections of Hermes `config.yaml`. Non-WAV speech output also needs `ffmpeg` on the Hermes computer.

For the desktop simulator, install its [audio extra](desktop.md#4-try-audio) and enable `--live-audio`. Board microphones and speakers use their firmware drivers.

**You know it worked when:** holding TALK captures your speech, releasing it sends the message, and the reply is both displayed and spoken.
