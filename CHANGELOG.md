# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Hardware and setup

- Show a QR code on the Wi-Fi setup screen so a phone camera can join the gadget's temporary network without typing. The code encodes the network name and password with the standard `WIFI:` scheme. The instructions stay printed beside it, since the phone still opens the setup address and some phones cannot scan. Screens without room for a scannable code beside the instructions keep the text-only screen.

### Firmware

- A console command that times out no longer leaves the app task writing its reply into freed memory. The request slot is shared by both tasks and freed by whichever finishes last, so a late reply is dropped instead of corrupting the stack. The slot is host-tested.

### Tools and documentation

- The Linux guide names the real approval command, `hermes gadget pair`. A test now checks that every `hermes gadget` and `hermes-gadget` command in the guides exists in the CLIs.

## 0.2.0

### Hardware and setup

- Add firmware profiles for Waveshare AMOLED-1.75C, Espressif ESP32-S3-BOX-3, M5Stack CoreS3, and LilyGO T-Display-S3. The release now covers seven ESP32-S3 profiles.
- Add phone-based Wi-Fi setup and recovery, including the dual-stack socket fix that allows IPv4 setup clients.
- Add on-device settings, hardware checks, and board-specific battery, brightness, and power controls.
- Provide Linux ARM64 packages for the experimental Raspberry Pi 4/5 client, including a service installer, updates, optional USB audio, GPIO controls, and display support.

### Tools and documentation

- Add a face generator and interactive feature picker. Copied commands preserve the image path, crop, rendering settings, and selected feature positions.
- Update the website, guided browser installer, and simulator conversation view. Publish setup, troubleshooting, hardware, and development guides with search.
- Add Home Assistant and MQTT examples and a Tailscale Funnel remote-access guide.
- Bundle third-party licenses and notices with firmware and Linux packages, with a license archive link in the installer.
- Add contribution requirements and automated documentation checks. CI discovers firmware profiles directly from PlatformIO.

### Upgrade and verification

Use the [browser installer](https://adolanium.github.io/hermes-gadget-sdk/installer.html) for USB installation. Existing devices can use `hermes gadget update <device> --latest`. Install the matching plugin using the commit-pinned command in the release notes. See [Linux installation and updates](docs/linux.md) for Raspberry Pi packages.

Hardware ports remain experimental until a complete physical report is recorded for the exact revision. The T-Display-S3 has a contributor-reported smoke check, but no complete verification report. Software tests and successful builds do not establish physical hardware verification; see [hardware capabilities and verification](docs/hardware-validation.md).
