## Choose your starting point

| I have a board | I want to try it first | I want to build with it |
|---|---|---|
| [Open the browser installer](https://adolanium.github.io/hermes-gadget-sdk/installer.html) | [Start the desktop simulator](docs/desktop.md) | [Explore the SDK](docs/development.md) |
| Install over USB, connect Wi-Fi, and pair with your Hermes. | Try a scripted demo, then connect your own Hermes. | Add a board, device actions, sensors, or your own face. |
| Chrome or Edge, a USB data cable, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and Hermes. No firmware toolchain. | Python 3.10+, CMake 3.16+, and a C++17 compiler. | Start with the development guide and tests. |

## What you can do

- **Talk and listen.** Hold TALK to speak, release to send, and hear your Hermes reply.
- **See what is happening.** Read replies, answer confirmation questions, and receive cards from your agent.
- **Let Hermes act.** Expose the gadget's LEDs, sensors, and other controls as agent tools.

Your Hermes does the thinking. Real conversations need Hermes Agent and the Gadget plugin. Voice also needs speech recognition and text-to-speech configured. The demo server gives scripted replies. Follow [Connect Hermes](docs/connect-hermes.md) when you are ready.

## Supported hardware

| Board | How you talk | Audio |
|---|---|---|
| [Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-1.54](docs/hardware.md#waveshare-esp32-s3-lcd-154) | Hold BOOT | Onboard microphones and speaker |
| [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75](docs/hardware.md#esp32-s3-touch-amoled-175) | Hold the screen | Onboard microphones; speaker output |
| [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C](docs/hardware.md#esp32-s3-touch-amoled-175c) | Hold the screen | Onboard microphones and speaker; experimental |
| [Espressif ESP32-S3-BOX-3](docs/hardware.md#esp32-s3-box-3) | Hold the screen or BOOT | Onboard microphones and speaker; experimental |
| [M5Stack CoreS3](docs/hardware.md#m5stack-cores3) | Hold the screen | Onboard audio and battery management; experimental |
| [ESP32-S3 breadboard build](docs/hardware.md) | Hold TALK | Wire the microphone and optional speaker |

Check the exact model and connections in the [hardware guide](docs/hardware.md). Other boards need a [port](docs/porting.md).

Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 have an experimental [Linux client](docs/linux.md) for
64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite Trixie. Add USB audio, GPIO controls, or a display
as needed. ARM64 release packages include the native core and a service installer.

These ports build in CI. Physical verification reports are not yet recorded; treat them as experimental until the [hardware verification table](docs/hardware-validation.md) links a report for your revision.

## Try the demo from a checkout

<details>
<summary>Already have Python, CMake, and a compiler? Start here.</summary>

In your activated environment at the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
hermes-gadget build-sim --test
hermes-gadget devserver --pairing
```

In a second terminal with the same environment activated:

```bash
hermes-gadget sim --url ws://127.0.0.1:8765/gadget --board sim-466x466-round
```

Type `approve <CODE>` in the first terminal, using the code on the device. Type a message in the simulator to receive a streamed echo. The [desktop guide](docs/desktop.md) covers platform-specific prerequisites and live audio.

## Project status

[Releases](https://github.com/Adolanium/hermes-gadget-sdk/releases/latest) include prebuilt firmware for the profiles listed in that release. Newly merged profiles need a source build until the next release. After the first USB flash, `hermes gadget update` installs new firmware over the air. A build that cannot reach Hermes rolls itself back.

The simulator and firmware share a portable C++17 core. CI tests the core, Python tools, installer, and plugin against a real Hermes gateway, and builds every supported board. The [development guide](docs/development.md) describes the test suites and pinned Hermes version.

After installing firmware, you can [configure Wi-Fi from your phone](docs/setup-board.md#set-up-wi-fi-with-your-phone) through the gadget's temporary network. USB setup remains available. Wake-word activation is not included.

The [Home Assistant and MQTT examples](docs/home-automation.md) expose a configured lamp and temperature sensor through a Linux gadget. They include pairing instructions, fixed action targets, asynchronous completion and local integration tests.
